# Simulations  

This folder contains the MATLAB script that reproduces the PID-based convergence plot for roll, pitch, and yaw.  

## How to Run  

- Open MATLAB.  
- Navigate to this folder (`simulations/`).  
- Run the script:  

```matlab
uav_pid_simulation
```

- The plot will automatically be saved in the `../docs/` folder as `uav_pid_plot.png`.
